Below is a detailed step‐by‐step plan for implementing a professional lead generation automation app. This plan covers all dependent files or additions, error handling best practices, modern UI/UX design, and real-world integrations.

---

**1. Dependencies & Environment Setup**

- Update package.json to add needed dependencies (install via npm/yarn):
  - "nodemailer" (for email sending)
  - "jspdf" (for invoice PDF generation)
  - "axios" (for API calls)
- Create or update an .env file (not committed) with environment variables for:
  - AI/LLM API key (e.g. OPENROUTER_API_KEY)
  - Social media API credentials (if using real APIs)
  - Email service credentials (e.g. SMTP configurations)
  - Database connection string (if using Supabase/PostgreSQL or SQLite)
- Update README.md to document required environment variables.

---

**2. Folder & File Structure Additions**

- In **src/app** (Next.js App Router), add new pages for the main functional areas:
  - **dashboard/page.tsx** – Main dashboard to view statistics, notifications, and quick actions.
  - **leads/page.tsx** – List and manage generated leads.
  - **chat/page.tsx** – Chat interface for AI/human-like interactions.
  - **invoices/page.tsx** – Invoice form and preview with download button.
- In **src/app/api/** create API endpoint folders with **route.ts** files:
  - **src/app/api/generate-leads/route.ts** – POST endpoint to trigger lead generation.
  - **src/app/api/send-message/route.ts** – POST endpoint to send cold messages and process AI conversations.
  - **src/app/api/generate-invoice/route.ts** – POST endpoint that generates an invoice PDF using jsPDF.
- In **src/lib/** create a new file:
  - **automation.ts** – Contains helper functions for:
    - Calling third-party social media APIs or scraping routines.
    - Invoking the AI platform via the OpenRouter endpoint (e.g., using model “anthropic/claude-sonnet-4” as default).
    - Wrapping email logic via Nodemailer.
    - Generic error handling and logging routines.

---

**3. File-by-File Implementation Outline**

- **package.json**  
  - Add the required dependencies under “dependencies”.  
  - Ensure scripts (e.g. “dev”, “start”) remain unchanged.

- **.env (new file, not in repo)**  
  - Add placeholders for API keys and other secrets.  
  - Example entries:  
  `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`  
  `SOCIAL_MEDIA_API_KEY=your_social_api_key_here`  
  `SMTP_USER=your_smtp_user`  
  `SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_pass`

- **src/app/dashboard/page.tsx**  
  - Create a modern, clean dashboard layout using plain typography, responsive grids, and ample spacing.  
  - Include sections for “Leads Overview”, “Recent Activity”, and quick actions (e.g. “Generate Leads”, “New Conversation”) using standard HTML elements styled via globals.css.  
  - Use clear headings and text buttons (no external icons).

- **src/app/leads/page.tsx**  
  - Display a table of leads (use existing UI/table.tsx from components/ui or create a custom table).  
  - Include error and empty state messages.  
  - Add filtering and sorting inputs with proper form validation.

- **src/app/chat/page.tsx**  
  - Build a conversation UI: a message list area, an input field, and a send button.  
  - The UI will call the /api/send-message endpoint to simulate human-like conversation.  
  - Ensure to include loading indicators and error messages if the API call fails.

- **src/app/invoices/page.tsx**  
  - Create an invoice creation form with fields (client name, date, items list, total amount).  
  - Include a “Generate Invoice” button that calls the /api/generate-invoice endpoint.  
  - On success, prompt a download using the jsPDF-generated file.  
  - Validate form input before submission.

- **src/app/api/generate-leads/route.ts**  
  - Create a POST endpoint that calls functions from automation.ts.  
  - Use try/catch for error handling and return proper HTTP response statuses (e.g. 200 on success, 500 with error message).

- **src/app/api/send-message/route.ts**  
  - Accept POST requests with message payload and lead details.  
  - Call an AI function from automation.ts that integrates with OpenRouter at `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions` using the model “anthropic/claude-sonnet-4” (or user-supplied key).  
  - Return the generated message or conversation response.

- **src/app/api/generate-invoice/route.ts**  
  - Accept invoice data via POST.  
  - In the handler, instantiate jsPDF to generate a PDF invoice and return it as a downloadable file stream.  
  - Use appropriate Content-Type headers and error handling.

- **src/lib/automation.ts**  
  - Export asynchronous functions like:  
    - generateLeads(): Call social media APIs (or simulate with dummy data) and log errors.
    - sendColdMessage(messageDetails): Wrap the AI API call using axios with proper headers.  
    - generateInvoicePDF(invoiceData): Use jsPDF to create a PDF buffer to be returned.  
  - Use try/catch within each function and log errors accordingly.
  
- **src/app/globals.css**  
  - Enhance typography (choose a modern web-safe font), spacing, and color contrast for a professional look.  
  - Add styles for forms, buttons, dashboard cards, error messages, and loading states.
  
- **Additional UI/UX Considerations:**  
  - Each page should include a header with the app name, a navigation menu (text links to Dashboard, Leads, Chat, Invoices).  
  - Ensure responsive design for desktop and mobile (use media queries).  
  - Utilize clear call-to-action buttons with hover effects and proper error message displays.  
  - No external icons or images are used; if a placeholder is needed (e.g., a marketing banner on Dashboard), use `<img src="https://placehold.co/1200x300?text=Professional+lead+automation+dashboard+banner" alt="Professional lead automation dashboard banner with modern minimalistic design" onerror="this.style.display='none'">`.

---

**4. Testing & Error Handling**

- Validate API endpoints using curl commands (as described in the guidelines); test each endpoint for both success and error scenarios.
- Ensure UI components handle loading states, empty data, and error messages gracefully.
- Use proper HTTP status codes and descriptive error messages in API responses.
- Log errors in automation.ts (either to the console or an external logging service).

---

**5. Integration with AI/LLM Functionality**

- Use the OpenRouter endpoint `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions` by calling it in the automation.ts function for sending messages.  
- Default to model “anthropic/claude-sonnet-4” if no other model is provided.  
- Ensure that client requests for chat messages are formatted as an array of message role objects, and handle multimodal inputs if later extended.
- Provide a system prompt (visible in a settings section or within code comments) to allow customization.

---

**Summary**  
- Updated package.json and .env to include necessary dependencies and API keys.  
- Added new pages under src/app for Dashboard, Leads, Chat, and Invoices with modern, responsive UI designs.  
- Created API endpoints in src/app/api for generating leads, sending messages, and generating invoices; each uses rigorous error handling.  
- Developed an automation.ts library for encapsulating social media scraping/API calls, AI integration via OpenRouter, and invoice PDF generation.  
- Enhanced global styling in globals.css for a clean, professional interface with proper typography and spacing.  
- Integrated real-world functionalities such as AI-based conversation (using anthropic/claude-sonnet-4) and PDF invoice generation via jsPDF.  
- Testing is planned using curl commands to ensure proper API responses and robust error handling.
